## Overview

Effective documentation is a crucial aspect of FAIR data management, ensuring that research data are not only well-organized but also easily discoverable, accessible, and reusable by others. In this section, we'll delve into the importance of documentation by exploring how to create best practice documentation that supports the entire research lifecycle. We'll cover the essential components like including metadata that provide context and description of the dataset, as well as README files that offer a concise introduction to the dataset. Additionally, we'll discuss the role of codebooks for making all components of the dataset self-explanatory.

## Metadata

Metadata are "data that provide information about other data"[^1], describing the context, content, and structure of a dataset. They contain essential information about the dataset, such as authorship, creation context, contents, provenance and accessibility. Metadata enable to understand and work with the data effectively. By providing a clear understanding of the data's origin, and meaning, metadata play a critical role in ensuring data quality, reproducibility, and FAIRness.

## Tips on where to find metadata

Metadata can be found at several places:

1.  Repository description: You are often asked about entering metadata, when you upload your dataset to a repository. The quality and extent of metadata you can provide varies from repository to repository. We will cover repositories in Chapter 3).

2.  README file: Already before you publish your dataset, you should keep track of your metadata, in order to prevent loosing the overview yourself, and for informing others. A good way to do that is creating a README file. We will cover README files in the next section.

3. Related publication: Most datasets that are published are connected to scientific papers, which detail what has been done to generate the dataset, what it consists of and its analysis process. While this can provide very detailed information, it makes it difficult to assess the dataset on its own.

## Solution: Example 1 
Answers from different sources have been brought together.

-   Who created the dataset? 
    + Göckede, Mathias; Reum, Friedemann; Heimann, Martin
-   What do the data files contain?
    + Atmospheric mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 at Ambarchik, NE Siberia,
    + Tabular data about measurements taken at the meteorological station for each month.  
-   When was the dataset generated?
    + The data were collected between August 2014 and December 2017. 
    + The dataset was published in 2023
-   Where was the dataset generated?
    + At the meteorological station in Ambarchik. Ambarchik is located at the mouth of the Kolyma River, which opens to the East Siberian Sea (69.62N, 162.30E).
-   Why was the dataset generated?
    + Unclear from the dataset alone
    + From the related publication: Sparse data coverage in the Arctic hampers our understanding of its carbon cycle dynamics and our predictions of the fate of its vast carbon reservoirs in a changing climate. In this paper, we present accurate measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) dry air mole fractions at the new atmospheric carbon observation station Ambarchik, which closes a large gap in the atmospheric trace gas monitoring network in northeastern Siberia.
-   How was the dataset generated?
    + The atmospheric carbon observation station Ambarchik consists of a 27 m tall tower with two air inlets and meteorological measurements, while the majority of the instrumentation is hosted in a rack inside a building. Atmospheric mole fractions of CH4 , CO2 , and H2O are measured by an analyzer based on the cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) technique (G2301, Picarro Inc.), which is calibrated against WMO-traceable reference gases at regular intervals. 
-   What research is this data set connected to?
    + Reum, F., Göckede, M., Lavric, J. V., Kolle, O., Zimov, S., Zimov, N., Pallandt, M., and Heimann, M.: Accurate measurements of atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane mole fractions at the Siberian coastal site Ambarchik, Atmos. Meas. Tech., 12, 5717-5740, 2019.

## Solution: Example 3 
Answers from different sources have been brought together.

-   Who created the dataset?\
    + Sarah Polk; Maike Kleemeyer (0000-0002-9388-5535)
-   What do the data files contain?\
    + This repository contains data and code for the manuscript entitled "Reliability of quantitative multiparameter maps is high for MT and PD but attenuated for R1 and R2* in healthy young adults"
    + The data folder contains the extracted data from the 11 different regions of interest (gray matter, white matter, pars triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, poster middle temporal gyrus, caudate, putamen, and pallidum) for each parameter map (MTsat, PD, R1, R2*) for each day (one and two) and each session (1 and 2). Regions of interest were taken from the Harvard-Oxford atlas as included in FSL 5.0.
-   When was the dataset generated?\
    + The data repository was created on November 3, 2021 and last modified on March 12, 2022 
    + Further information on the time frame of the data creation is unclear on dataset level. 
-   Where was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
-   Why was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From the related publication: In sum, in this sample of healthy young adults, the four MPM parameters showed very little variability over four measurements over two days but differed in how well they could assess between-person differences. We conclude that R1 and R2* might carry only limited person-specific information in samples of healthy young adults, and, by implication, might be of restricted utility for studying associations to between-person differences in behavior.
-   How was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From the related publication: We acquired data from 15 volunteers, who each were assessed four times. On Day 1, participants were measured twice back-to-back, without repositioning between MPM datasets. On Day 2, participants were also measured twice, but this time with a break in between measurements, which afforded repositioning of the participants’ head.
-   What research is this dataset connected to?\
    + Article: "Reliability of quantitative multiparameter maps is high for MT and PD but attenuated for R1 and R2* in healthy young adults"
    + [https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.467254](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.10.467254) (Not provided on dataset level)
-   Can this dataset be re-used?\
    + The provided dataset does not have a license. Re-use is therefore unclear.

-   Who created the dataset?\
    + Dominik Deffner; Benjamin (Kahl) 
-   What do the data files contain?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From file structure: Data from 40 Group sessions and 40 solo sessions with relating scripts. 
    + From related Github repository: This repository contains the full data and scripts to reproduce all analyses and figures as well as the experimental game itself used in Deffner, D., Mezey, D., Kahl, B., Schakowski, A., Romanczuk, P., Wu, C. & Kurvers, R. (accepted, in principle, at Nature Communications): "Collective incentives reduce over-exploitation of social information in unconstrained human groups"
-   When was the dataset generated?\
    + From file structure: Sessions were between July 5th, 2022 and September 21, 2022.
    + The dataset was published on February 12, 2024.
-   Where was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level.
    + From the related publication: At the Max Planck Institute for Human Development 
-   Why was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From the related publication: Collective dynamics emerge from countless individual decisions. Yet, we poorly understand the processes governing dynamically-interacting individuals in human collectives under realistic conditions. We present a naturalistic immersive-reality experiment where groups of participants searched for rewards in different environments, studying how individuals weigh personal and social information and how this shapes individual and collective outcomes.
-   How was the dataset generated?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From related publication: 160 participants were recruited from the Max Planck Institute for Human Development (MPIB) recruitment pool and invited in anonymous groups of four to the behavioral laboratory at the MPIB in Berlin, Germany (63 identified as male, 97 as female; Mage = 28.5, SDage = 6.4 years; all were proficient in German and most came from Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic societies70,71). Fourty additional participants were recruited for an individual control condition (14 identified as male, 26 as female; Mage = 29.8, SDage = 5.7 years). See further section: "Procedure"
-   What research is this dataset connected to?\
    + Not indicated on dataset level. 
    + From related GitHub Repository: Deffner, D., Mezey, D., Kahl, B., Schakowski, A., Romanczuk, P., Wu, C. & Kurvers, R. (accepted, in principle, at Nature Communications): "Collective incentives reduce over-exploitation of social information in unconstrained human groups"

## Excursion: Community Standards
Community standards for metadata allow for improved comparison between datasets. Some disciplines have agreed-upon formal standards that define how metadata should be documented. If you publish your data via a discipline specific repository, it is likely that their entry form already guides you through the community metadata standard. You can look for metadata standards that are specific to your discipline e.g. via [FAIRsharing.org](https://fairsharing.org/search?fairsharingRegistry=Standard). If a standard for your research field exists, you should follow it as good as possible.

Even if your discipline does not adhere to strict standards, there is an advantage in using generic standards. By using controlled vocabularies or ontologies for your metadata you can increase the machine-readability and -actionability of your data.

Machine-readability refers to the ability of machines (computers, algorithms, etc.) to automatically understand and interpret the meaning of metadata, such as keywords, descriptions, and concepts, without human intervention. Machine-actionability takes it a step further, enabling machines to not only understand the metadata but also to perform actions or take decisions based on that metadata, such as data integration, filtering, or visualization, without human intervention.
:::

## README file

We already established that metadata and README files are strongly connected. They form a great way to provide an introduction to and documentation of a dataset and its research context. A README file is a plain text file often written in markdown and then named "README.md". This naming convention helps spotting the README file for humans and machines alike, e.g. in GitHub repositories the README.md file is identified automatically and its content displayed on the repositories main page. The README file should be one of the first files your create for a new project. You can then continue filling it with the relevant information.

What should be in a README file? - Ideally all the answers to the questions posed under the metadata section should be given in the README file. To determine what should be best included in your README file, it can also be helpful to go through the questions of a [Research Data Management Plan](dmp.qmd). While your README file should be very descriptive, it is also important to stay concise and clear. Avoid e.g. using jargon to improve inter-disciplinary usage.

## Codebook

Whereas general metadata and README information typically focus on the dataset or project as a whole, codebooks delve deeper, providing detailed explanations and clarifications about the specific data contained in individual files. A code book should make all components of a dataset file self-explanatory. It helps to identify e.g. what certain variables and value labels mean or in which format the data points have been collected. This enhances the FAIRness of the dataset, because it allows to re-use it independent of the availability an associated research paper.

Some people include this information in the README file. However, this can significantly extent the length of the README. We recommend to keep README files concise to maintain their readability.

If all of your data files are structured and labeled according to the same system it is enough to provide one codebook that describes and explains this system. If you have differently structured files you should consider providing multiple codebooks.

Here are some of the elements that can be included in a codebook:

-   variables
-   value labels
-   measuring unit
-   data types
-   data format
-   data dictionary
-   data quality notes
-   technical info

### Basic level:

A first step is to provide this information about your data is in a .csv table, a .txt file or .md (markdown) file. These are easy to create via a text editor of your choice. They can be opened by everyone independent of proprietary systems and are easily readable by humans.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
# Example of a simple .csv codebook

"variable","data_type","format"\
"species","string","Adelie,Chinstrap,Gentoo"\
"population_size","integer","0-100000"\
"location","string","Latitude, Longitude"\
"date","string","YYYY-MM-DD"\
"latitude","number","-90 to 90"\
"longitude","number","-180 to 180"\
:::

### Advanced level:

Depending on the complexity of your data, you can improve your codebook by providing it as a JSON file. This has the advantage to be machine-readable and -actionable. It makes it easier to extract this information and work with it in coding scripts.
